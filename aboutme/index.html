    <p>I love playing video games and I also enjoy playing  tenis Ball and I also enjoy reading story books and Scripturs my favorite Scripture is Alma 29:9 I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy. I love this quote from Elder Robert D. Hales, The choices you make,mission, education, marriage, career, and service in the Church,will shape your eternal destiny.</p>
